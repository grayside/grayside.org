This was supposed to be my next blog post, when I finished mulling it over. Then I saw @open_atrium tweet the exact words.

I've been wondering what good a Feature Server is if every individual server had to handle it's own marketing if anyone was going to learn about it. Google is a bit hard to use with keywords like "Drupal Feature".
