If you've delved into some of the enhanced bookmarking magic in Firefox, you know that entering the world of the *Organize Bookmarks* tool provides some additional options in how you save your bookmarks.

[Custom Keywords](http://www.mozilla.org/docs/end-user/keywords.html) are really neat. I use them for Drupal reference all the time. It's my preferred method for bouncing around CVS, the API, and issue queues. Typing "`d6 hook_nodeapi`" to double check the ops parameter is very nice. Typing "`dcm og`" to start researching how og access control works will save a page load.

Attached is a drupal-bookmarks.html file that will get you a leg up on the boring process of creating these bookmarks.

It includes Drupal Project, Drupal Project Issues, Drupal Project Usage, Drupal CVS Modules, Drupal CVS Core, Drupal Site search, Drupal 6 API lookup, and Drupal 7 API lookup.

(You can create something similar in Chrome, but it's not done through bookmarks. Setting up [Custom Search Engines](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/create-custom-search-engines-google-chrome/) is very similar, and I don't see an easy mechanism for exportables.)
