[OpenAtrium](http://openatrium.com) has some pretty slick styling of it's node add/edit form. Unfortunately, when you add a [CCK](http://drupal.org/project/cck) field to it, you get something comparatively under-styled and in the main column of the form.

If you want to get that slick styling and move the CCK fields to the right, try the following:

  1. Go to `admin/build/modules` and enable the *Fieldgroup* module under CCK.
  2. Go to the `Manage Fields` page for your content type. Create a new group, the machine name starting as `group_sidebar`.
  3. Move your CCK fields under that group.

Voil√†! Make it collapsible as you like.
